        Proficient in utilizing frameworks such as React.js and Bootstrap, I've
        also delved into the world of server-side development with a grasp on
        Node.js and Express.js.

        This semester, I achieved a notable milestone by creating a website for
        monitoring tricopter conditions. Using React.js for the frontend, PHP
        for the backend, and MySQL for the database. I demonstrated my skills in web development. This
        project exemplifies my ability to apply diverse technologies to
        real-world solutions, and I'm eager to take on more innovative
        challenges in the future.
